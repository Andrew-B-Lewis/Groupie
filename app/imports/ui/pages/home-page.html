      'Groupie' is a web app designed by Andrew Lewis and Truc Duong as part of a project <br />
      for CS 320 at Washington State University: Vancouver. <br />
      The app is designed for students to manage group work more effectively by combining <br />
      resources from multiple online tools into one platform. <br /><br />

      Currently, Groupie is in the style and implementation phase.
